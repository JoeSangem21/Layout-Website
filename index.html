        <h3> New York Sports Teams </h3>
      <h4> New York has amazing sports Teams. These teams that are featured are really some of New York's finest and my favorite teams. My favorite MLB Baseball team is the New York Mets. My favorite NHL Hockey team is the New York Islanders. My favorite NBA Basketball team is the New York Knicks. These are all of my favorite New York sports teams and something that they have in common is that they all have the same color scheme of blue, orange, and white. These are my favorite New York Sports Teams.  </h4>
